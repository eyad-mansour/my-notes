## you should not

- writing code that isn’t needed
- increase complexity by adding unnecessary codes
- too generic
- missing deadlines
- dealing with many bugs caused by the complexity

## but you need to

1. Plan a system that does only addition and nothing else.
2. Implement it.
3. Improve the now-existing system’s design so you can add other operations also.
4. Plan subtraction and repeat step 2 and 3.
5. Plan multiplication and repeat step 2 and 3.
6. Plan division and repeat step 2 and 3.
